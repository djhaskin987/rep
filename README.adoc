rep
===

https://github.com/eraserhd/rep

A single-shot nREPL client designed for shell invocation.

This connects to a running nREPL server (like kind started with `lein repl`,
for example), sends some code to be evaluated, and prints the results and
output.

....
$ rep '(clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh)'
:reloading ()
:ok
....

Unlike other nREPL clients, `rep` does not try to maintain a persistent
connection, meaning that thread-local variables and bindings like `*e` and
`*1` will not persist across invocations of `rep`.  Perhaps there are
other limitations because of this?

Installation
------------

Download the latest Linux or MacOS binaries from the GitHub releases tab
above.

Usage, Options, and Examples
----------------------------

See https://github.com/eraserhd/rep/blob/develop/rep.1.adoc[the rep manpage].

Building
--------

https://nixos.org/nix/download.html[Nix] is the build tool. Weird, yes, but
this project has a brittle set of peculiar dependencies and Nix allows us to
pin down _everything_.

....
$ nix-build .
....

A `result` symlink will appear in the current directory point to the build
output.

Running Tests
-------------

To run all the tests that CI runs, the way CI runs them (do this before
issuing a pull request):

....
$ nix-build release.nix
....

Using with Kakoune
------------------

The `rc/` folder contains scripts which add a `,e` user mode to Kakoune.  To
link this to Kakoiune's autoload directory, do the following:

....
$ make install
....

`rep` must be in the path for the plugin to work.
